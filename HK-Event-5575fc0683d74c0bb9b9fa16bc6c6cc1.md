- Wei: Near the summit, I'm going to do the talk on "etclient" in the local Codeaholics meetup on Nov 8 (7-9pm at CoCoon). Decided to do it in this instead of in the Summit because it just has more developers! If just you happen to come to Hong Kong early, save the date.

> Isaac: Darn it! My flight leaves the 9th :( Break a leg!
