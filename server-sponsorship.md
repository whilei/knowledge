### Overview
The sponsorship program is designed to encourage the opportunity for ETCDEV team members to build, rent, or otherwise maintain their own server or servers for development work with team technologies, with an encouraged emphasis on at least running a permanent geth node or nodes.

The intention of the sponsorship is to give developers environments for:

1. __development__, eg.
  - run other OS test suites
  - enable a node serving RPC to develop against
  - store blockchain data for development or testing, like 5 millions accounts, examples of broken chaindata dbs...
  - debugging the Wallet Window's build without having to use Appveyor
2. __experimentation__, eg.
  - will geth run on FreeBSD?
  - what can we do with low power/performance/IoT devices?
  - can we run the Wallet on Android?
  - what about running emerald-cli in a refrigerator?
3. __monitoring and product feedback__, eg.
  - run a Morden node
  - mine on Morden
  - run a mainnet node, watch log generation rates
  - run a mainnet node and monitor network health

These examples are obviously the tip of the iceberg, and are obviously interrelated; if we build a tool to monitor shared data between our nodes (ala etcstats.net), then we've done development _and_ monitoring. A two-fer!

### Participation
The program is an opportunity, not a requirement.

### Reimbursement
Team members wishing to participate can receive up to $200USD/month in reimbursement for server or computational expenses invested in the associated costs of running one or multiple development servers. Reimbursement up to this value does not require receipts to be submitted or proofed; it is a good-will sponsorship.

Anything totaling above $200USD/month should be run past the team for general consensus and to check your dumbass before trying to buy a $10000 hard drive, and @splix has final public veto/approval priviledges.

Standard reimbursement requests should be sent to @splix with the amount requested and the date of your last request, and should be submitted by the end of Thursday to receive the value requested the next Monday.

### Server requirements
There are no specified requirements or mandates for what kind of server(s)
are eligible; all OS's and hardware are allowed. The general rule is: if it seems beneficial for you and the team :thumbs_up:. For hosting a personal Plex server?... not so much.

It'd be great if we can get a diversity of server setups across the team to keep track of and experiment with "funky" systems, as well as keep "standard" systems close and in-use to expose ourselves to direct feedback for general use cases. If you get something spun up â€“ let the team know!

> Maybe we can create a table or spreadsheet just to keep track of who's got what running for reference...?
