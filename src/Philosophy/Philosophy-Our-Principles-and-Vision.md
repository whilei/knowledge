# Philosophy: Our Principles and Vision

What's our purpose? What are the guiding principles that dictate our actions?

# **Technology, not a product**

We are working on Ethereum Classic as a technology, and as protocol and tools for developers. 

Making a product from it is not our primary goal. 

Instead of providing an ultimate node implementation, or an ultimate wallet for ETC, we would rather provide a set of components for different implementations, different modules and tools for 3rd party developers.

# **Apache 2 license**

We don’t want to limit usage of ETC technology. Any 3rd party developer or business should be able to adopt part of our technologies into their applications without any restriction. To allow that we have been developing all our new projects under the business friendly license,  _Apache 2_ .

The only exception at the moment is  _Geth Classic_ , which came from EF and it was already licensed under  _GPL/LGPL_ . Unfortunately, we can’t do anything with that now. We will continue Geth development under same license. This is currently our main client and a reference implementation. We will continue to maintain it and add new features as well.

To improve that situation with Geth license we have a strategy to provide replacements for critical parts as a separate modules. This will useful for 3rd party developers. Development of these modules will be from scratch and licensed under Apache 2 as well. This will include new EVM, State storage and network protocol library.

# **Roadmap is NOT motivated by Money**

We don’t implement features in return to donations or investments. And every major decision related to core development comes through Ethereum Classic community discussion and ECIP process.

# **Working closely with the community**

We are a standalone team, but our intention is to help Ethereum Classic. We follow Open Source principles for development. We’re dedicated to the growth of the Ethereum Classic community. There are many other members in Ethereum Classic community who work on projects with us, participate in discussion, send Pull Requests and ECIPs, and provide other help. We’re working together on towards a common goal.
